Changes from released version of 5.2:


ncluded routine for performing HWW+jet analysis (hwwjetplots.f).
Added ability to calculate WW and WZ processes with anomalous TGC's when
 zerowidth is set to .false. (singly-resonant diagrams are excluded).
Changed calculation of PDF uncertainties to conform with CHS Eq. (43),
 both in total cross section (mcfm_exit.f) and in histograms (ebook.f).
Changed name of output file to include both renormalization and fac. scales.
Improved behavour of i3m.f for small parameters.
Changed b0 common block to be compatible with Looptools (for future WW+jet).
Made sure that errors are plotted for LO and dryrun=.true.
Corrected error output, especially at intermediate stages.
Ensured that b0 uses correct number of flavours (coupling2.f).
Added mrst2004 PDF set (fdist_linux, pdfwrap_linux, mrst2004 and data files).
Added ZZ+jet process (chooser, lowint_incldip, process.DAT) - #85.
Removed reference to HWWjet in dipolesub.f (wrong) and decreased tolerance
 for error-checking in gg_hg_gvec.f.
Improved precision in gs_wc_dg.f.
Corrected real subtractions for single-top decay processes.
Suppressed error message printing in the fixed-flavour MRST2004 sets.
Improved behaviour of breitw for very small masses.
Checked for processes 342 and 352 that part=lord is not being run (checkorder.f)
Added plots to nplotter.f for Z+Q+jet process to check if leading jet is Q.
Upgraded dswhbook.f to handle more particles in the final state.
Changed chooser to introduce H->WW in WBF process (213). Also added VV_HWW.f, 
 WW_HWW.f, ZZ_HWW.f (and NLO counterparts), phase7a.f and changed phase6.f.
Added initialscales.f, dipolescale.f, and changed reader_input.f and
 dipolesub.f, dipolesubx.f to implement dynamic scale in dipole terms correctly.
Changed aveptjet.f to work with new dynamic scale implementation.
Implemented error-handling for "scheme" in dipoles.f
Implemented "scheme" properly in dipoles_mass.f (with error-handling too)
Corrections to integrated subtractions (endpoint contribution) in dipoles_mass.f
Added cs->W process in process.DAT and implemented it via changes in
 chooser.f, virtint_incldip.f, realint.f and phase3.f.
Changed mcfm_init.f to implement minimum x-value of 10^-8 always.
Corrected bug in qqb_w_cjet_g.f. 
Added note about "-static" compiler flag for LHAPDF in the documentation.
Modified alfamz.f to run alpha-s correctly for 3 and 4 flavour PDFs.
Added special behavior for runstring="mlm..." for MLM W+c study
Changed output slightly in writeinfo.f
Changed chooser to introduce H->WW for WH, ZH processes. Also added qqb_wh_ww.f,
 qqb_zh_ww.f (and NLO counterparts), phase7b.f and changed phase6.f.
Corrected gg contribution in qqb_zccm.f
Changed dips_mass.f to implement dynamic scale correctly (as above).
Changed qqb_QQb_gs.f, qqb_w_cjet_gs.f, qqb_w_tndk_gs.f qqb_w_twdk_gs.f to
 not call _gvec routines when unnecessary for final-initial and final-final.
Changed structure of "dsw" routines slightly, to allow for ROOT ntuple output
 via FROOT. Added FROOT interface, mcfm_froot.f and froot.c in src/User/
Added FROOT option to makefile.
Increased number of allowed PDF error sets from 40 to 50.
Added routine "checkgvec" (authors only: for checking _gvec routines).
Corrected qqb_QQb_gvec.f; slightly modifies gg contribution to tt~ at NLO.
Amended histofin.f so that empty plots are not counted in Topdrawer output.
Changed call to bookfill in nplotter.f so that weights are correctly divided
 by the number of iterations in ntuples.
Corrected overall weight in phase7m_alt.f
Corrected dswhbook.f and mcfm_froot.f to use chosen factorization scale when
 writing to ntuples.
Corrected t-channel single-top subtractions in qqb_tbb_gs.f.
Changed tt+decay LO (KS) matrix elements to remove unnecessary widths.
Implemented correct tt+jet (with decay) matrix elements.
